# Jobly Exemplar Project

## Description

This application will be built using the battle-tested PERN stack - **P**ostgreSQL, **E**xpress, **R**eact, and **N**ode.

Check out the live [deployed Jobly website](http://jobly-codepath-react-ui.surge.sh/)!

## Goals

Building this application will ask interns to accomplish the following:

- Boostrap a PostgreSQL, Node, and Express API with sample data
- Use JWT tokens to allow users to make authenticated requests to the Express API
- Store user-authenticated JWT tokens in the browser's local storage for persisted authentication
- Create custom hooks on a React frontend to access and store values in localStorage and utilize `onKeyPress` handlers
- Employ the `useContext` hook to store global application state
- Create login and signup forms to manage user registration and authentication
- Leverage React Router to construct dynamic routes and pages
- Build search functionality into the frontend and backend of the application
- Protect frontend routes from access by unauthenticated users
